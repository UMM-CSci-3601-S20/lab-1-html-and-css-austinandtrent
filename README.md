# CSci 3601 Lab #1 - HTML and CSS Lab

In this lab you will learn to alter the look of a simple HTML website using CSS,
following best practices and using validated code, all while maintaining
good version control. Previous versions of this lab had students create
both HTML and CSS, but we were inspired by [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)
to have students focus on understanding how CSS alone can greatly alter the
look and feel of a web page. Use of flexbox helps make html elements scale
with screen size. This is useful for making a webpage usable for mobile devices
or small screens.

Your specific tasks for this lab can be found in the [LABTASKS.md](LABTASKS.md)
file in this repository.

## Setup Instructions

Clone your repository to your local working environment.

On GitHub, you'll need to visit the *settings* for your repository and change
the *GitHub Pages* settings. Under the "Source" section, you'll need to select
the branch `master`, and save your settings.

> Doing this will 'host' your website, specifically the version that is on
> your `master` branch. This means that everything you push to `master`
> will, in a sense, be 'published' - hence it is important that you practice
> responsible version control and only push completed features to your `master`
> branch.
>
> When you publish your site to GitHub pages, GitHub will display the URL
> where you can find your published site. The primary repo we use to manage
> changes to this lab across semesters is published
> at <http://umm-csci-3601.github.io/3601-lab1_HTML-CSS/>;
> yours will be at a different URL but should look somewhat similar.
>
> :bangbang: Once you have that URL, please include it in the "Website" box in the
> description at the top of your GitHub project page. Click the "Edit" button on the
> right hand side (just under "Settings") and that should give you a "Description" and
> a "Website" box; paste the URL into the "Website" box. That will make it a lot easier
> for us to go through all the projects and see your work.

## "Running" your project

To view your website, you should be able to simply open the `index.html` file in your
browser of choice. (In most cases, 'double clicking' the file should do this. In Visual Studio Code,
you can right click on the file, choose "Copy Path", and paste that into the browser's URL bar.)

Remove this line from your `README.md` file. Replace the URL in the next subsection with your
team's GitHub.io URL, which should look something like
this: <http://umm-csci-3601.github.io/3601-lab1_HTML-CSS/> but will not be identical.

### Our Team's GitHub Pages URL

> You should replace the link below with a link to *your* group's GitHub Pages
> URL. Remember to also add that to your project description at the top of
> your team's repo on GitHub. You can remove this note when you've done these
> things.

<http://umm-csci-3601.github.io/3601-lab1_HTML-CSS/>

### Version Control Reminder

Remember to practice good version control! New features should be developed in
feature branches, [commit messages should be in the present tense and provide
meaningful information](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/),
and you should use pull requests on GitHub to merge
changes from feature branches into your master branch.
